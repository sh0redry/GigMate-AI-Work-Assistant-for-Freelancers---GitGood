# Implementation status and validation

Milestone: **v0.2 replay skeleton**. Recorded: **2026-10-01**. Maintainer: current repository owner. This is a completed-work record; future updates must add actual commands/results and revise remaining work.

## Completed

| Area | Implemented result | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Environment | Fixed Python/Node/PostgreSQL, backend and npm locks, loopback-only Compose | infra, .env.example, runtime version files |
| Backend | FastAPI API, strict Pydantic contracts, health, structured errors and request IDs | apps/backend/src/gigmate |
| Persistence | 13 initial tables, explicit migration, idempotent synthetic seed | migrations/versions/0001_replay_foundation.py |
| Identity | Two isolated development accounts, scrypt passwords, hashed sessions, HttpOnly/SameSite cookies, CSRF/origin checks | identity.py, api.py |
| Messaging | Allowlisted text/edit/revoke replay, identity deduplication, revision checks, context advancement before extraction | messaging.py |
| Worker | Durable jobs, PostgreSQL SKIP LOCKED, leases, three-attempt failures, recovery from database outages | worker.py |
| Domain | Proposals only, provenance checks, stale-version rejection, overlap rejection, atomic order/calendar/generated-task/audit updates | workorders.py, planning.py |
| Frontend | Login, order list, source timeline, conflict/stale states, explicit confirmation, calendar and tasks | apps/web |
| Contracts | Generated domain schema, implemented OpenAPI, generated frontend types and drift checks | scripts/export_contracts.py, scripts/check_web_contracts.mjs |
| Verification | API/domain tests, HTTP smoke, lint/format/build and CI definitions | tests, scripts, .github/workflows |

Only generated pending tasks are cancelled by rescheduling; unrelated manual and completed tasks remain. Confirmed state is not written by the fixed extractor. Its scope is two exact synthetic examples, not general language understanding.

## Evidence

- Windows native tooling: Python 3.12.10, Node 24.15.0, npm 11.12.1. Linux containers were built and run with PostgreSQL 17.9.
- docker compose up --build -d --wait: completed; database/API healthy, worker running, migration exited successfully, web available on 18080.
- Alembic upgrade head and check: successful; no model/migration drift.
- PostgreSQL suite: 26 tests passed: 18 behavior tests plus 8 original domain-fixture compatibility checks against canonical runtime models. Includes concurrent claim, bounded retries and database-outage recovery. SQLite is a test fallback and skips the PostgreSQL-specific claim test.
- Ruff check/format, generated-schema drift, original positive/negative fixtures, frontend generated-type drift, TypeScript/production build: passed.
- Browser workflow: conflicting 15:00 proposal disabled confirmation; 16:30 proposal was explicitly confirmed; work-order version advanced from 3 to 4, calendar changed, old generated task cancelled, new task persisted; missing address remained missing.
- HTTP smoke against web proxy: login, replay/worker, confirmation or existing confirmed state, calendar/tasks, duplicate handling and logout passed.
- Restart verification: database/API/worker restarted; the same confirmed schedule and dependent records remained and repeat smoke passed.
- Resume verification: Docker Desktop was initially stopped; after starting it and running Compose up --wait, services recovered and the persisted-state HTTP smoke passed again. Baseline and generated-contract checks also passed again.

The test suite emits one upstream Starlette/httpx deprecation warning; it does not fail checks. CI workflows are configured but have not run on GitHub because these changes have not been pushed. No independently timed new-contributor onboarding study was performed.

## Remaining

Live WAHA capabilities and engine/version pinning; general model extraction and evaluation; multi-order classification UI; other requirement fields and rejection/edit commands; action approval/outbox/sending/reconciliation; full calendar buffers/work hours; production authentication; retention/deletion automation; media and external calendars.

The original 12 acceptance scenarios remain targets. Some internal cases now have service tests; external unknown-send/API-echo/send-race cases do not. Do not use this skeleton to process real accounts or claim full P0 completion.
